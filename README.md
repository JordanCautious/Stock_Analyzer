# ðŸ“Š Stock_Analyzer 

Welcome to my first Data Analysis project!

This is the code for the Web App that can found below:

<a href="https://share.streamlit.io/jordancautious/stock_analyzer/main.py
">Web App</a>

This is a pretty simple project, but it's made to be improved over time.
Likewise, this means that this readme will also be updated with it.

This can also be seen as a proof of concept of what Streamlit can do.

Anyway, I hope you like it!
